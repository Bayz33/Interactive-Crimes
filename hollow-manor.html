      <h2>Case 7: The Hollow Manor Haunting</h2>
      <p class="blurb"><strong>Halloween Special — Difficulty: Extreme</strong></p>
      <p class="blurb">
        On Halloween night five friends broke into Hollow Manor for a dare. Four returned; Vanessa Clarke did not. Police called it a runaway, but recovered evidence suggests someone planned that night—and several people lied about what they saw.
      </p>
      <p class="blurb"><strong>Your mission:</strong> determine who orchestrated the "haunting", why they did it, and which piece of evidence exposes them — while sorting truth from deliberate lies.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="witnesses">
      <h2>Witness Statements (survivors & locals)</h2>

      <div class="witness">
        <strong>Liam (survivor)</strong>: “I stepped out to the porch for a smoke — when I turned back the others were inside. Vanessa was with Jenna. I ran for my phone when I heard a crash, then I ran.”  
        <em>(Liam later says he left before things got dark.)</em>
      </div>

      <div class="witness">
        <strong>Rosa (survivor)</strong>: “I heard whispering and footsteps in the attic. I went up and saw shadow — I screamed and left. I didn’t touch anything.”  
        <em>(Rosa’s shoes were later found with wet mud.)</em>
      </div>

      <div class="witness">
        <strong>Jenna (survivor)</strong>: “We were messing with the old Ouija board as a joke. Vanessa stared at the portrait and then vanished from the hallway. I stayed to call for help.”  
        <em>(Jenna claimed she never left Vanessa’s side.)</em>
      </div>

      <div class="witness">
        <strong>Felix (survivor, prankster)</strong>: “It was only me doing spooky stuff — wiring a speaker to play whispers. I didn’t touch Vanessa. I swear I was on the back lawn.”  
        <em>(Felix was observed earlier buying batteries and an amplifier.)</em>
      </div>

      <div class="witness">
        <strong>Oscar (former caretaker)</strong>: “I was fired years ago. People say the Manor is cursed — but I left that night before midnight. I had no reason to harm anyone.”  
        <em>(Oscar still holds a master ring of keys in his truck.)</em>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="evidence">
      <h2>Evidence Locker</h2>

      <div class="evidence"><strong>Corrupted Phone File (Vanessa’s last clip):</strong> Audio with a faint male whisper, then static — file metadata shows it was saved at 11:07pm, but a hidden image frame exists showing a reflection in a cracked mirror.</div>

      <div class="evidence"><strong>Wet Mud on Rosa’s Shoes:</strong> Mud traces match a path behind the manor where the caretaker’s service shed sits.</div>

      <div class="evidence"><strong>Ouija Board Notes:</strong> Smeared ink and a torn corner with handwriting that matches Jenna’s grocery receipt signature.</div>

      <div class="evidence"><strong>Keychain with 'Hollow' tag:</strong> Found in the underbrush near the back gate; engraving shows initials “O.P.”</div>

      <div class="evidence"><strong>Vanessa’s Journal:</strong> Final entry: “If anything happens, check the cracked mirror. — V.”</div>

      <p class="hint">Note: Lies appear in alibis (who says they left), in statements about touching evidence, and in claimed motives — not every inconsistency is proof of guilt, but purposeful contradictions are.</p>
