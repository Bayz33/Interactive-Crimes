      <h2 id="premise-heading">The Case</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>On Thanksgiving evening, the fellowship hall of <strong>New Promise Chapel</strong> was full. Folding tables lined with turkey, stuffing, and steaming pans of gravy stretched wall to wall. Almost the entire congregation—just over a hundred people—stayed after the service to eat.</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes after the meal began, people started to collapse.</p>
        <p>By the time paramedics arrived, every guest who had eaten the gravy was violently ill. Dozens were hospitalized. Three remain in critical condition.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors moved quickly. They charged <strong>Pastor Elijah Ward</strong> with orchestrating a mass poisoning, claiming he used the chaos to target one specific parishioner he secretly hated. The media branded him the “Thanksgiving Wolf.”</p>
        <p>But when you are brought in as an outside investigator, the district attorney quietly admits something unsettling:</p>
        <p><em>The timeline does not actually work if the pastor is the one who did it.</em></p>
        <p>Your job is to review the scene, the witness statements, and the physical evidence and identify the <strong>real poisoner</strong>.</p>

          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 1 — Access to the kitchen</span>
            <span>The church kitchen stayed unlocked all afternoon. However, the <strong>chemical storage shed</strong> behind the church—where old pesticides and lawn supplies are kept—requires a key. Only three people officially have keys: <strong>Pastor Ward</strong>, <strong>Marla Green</strong> (church treasurer), and <strong>DeAndre Holt</strong> (volunteer custodian and cook).</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 2 — The pastor’s alibi</span>
            <span>Phone recordings and livestream footage confirm that Pastor Ward was on the pulpit <strong>from 4:30 p.m. until 4:58 p.m.</strong> without leaving. Several choir members say he hurried directly from the pulpit to the main entrance to greet people as they left, staying in the sanctuary foyer until guests headed downstairs at 5:05 p.m.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 3 — When the gravy was safe</span>
            <span>Two volunteers, <strong>Anne Lopez</strong> and <strong>Eric Pike</strong>, tasted the gravy around <strong>4:40 p.m.</strong> while adjusting the seasoning. Both report it tasted “normal” at that time. The pot was then carried to the warmer in the fellowship hall and covered with a lid.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 4 — The missing gloves</span>
            <span>In the trash near the back door, officers found a pair of disposable food-service gloves smeared with gravy. Trace analysis shows the same pesticide on the gloves. The security camera above that door has been “broken for months,” according to staff.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 5 — The insurance mailer</span>
            <span>Earlier that week, an envelope from a life insurance company addressed to <strong>Lydia Price</strong> was found in the church office trash. She is a long-time congregant and the mother of <strong>Julia Price</strong>, a city health inspector. The envelope advertised large accidental-death payouts for family policy holders.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 6 — Financial stress</span>
            <span>Bank records show that the church is in serious debt. However, the treasurer, <strong>Marla Green</strong>, quietly took out a personal loan in her own name after several thousand dollars went “missing” from the church building fund. She insists she did this to secretly cover bookkeeping mistakes so “no one would panic.”</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 7 — The targeted plate</span>
            <span>Prosecutors claim the pastor meant to kill <strong>Caleb Ward</strong>, his estranged son, who came to the dinner with a confrontational attitude. However, serving-line witnesses state that Caleb <strong>refused the gravy completely</strong>, joking that it looked “like wallpaper paste.” He still became ill later—but only mildly—from cross-contamination on his plate.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="evidence-item">
            <span class="evidence-label">Evidence 8 — Who stayed behind</span>
            <span>When everyone went upstairs for the 4:30 p.m. service, three people remained in or near the kitchen at various points: <strong>DeAndre</strong> finished cleaning knives and pans, <strong>Marla</strong> walked in to check the donation box and carry cash to the office, and <strong>Julia</strong> stepped in briefly to get coffee before joining the service.</span>

      <div id="solution" class="card solution-card hidden">
        <p class="solution-step"><strong>The correct culprit is: Marla Green, the treasurer.</strong></p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>1. The pastor’s timeline removes him.</strong><br>
          At first glance, Pastor Ward seems like the obvious villain. But livestream footage and multiple witnesses keep him either on the pulpit or in the foyer greeting people from <strong>4:30 p.m. until 5:05 p.m.</strong> The gravy was tasted and found normal at 4:40 p.m., then moved and covered. For him to poison it, he would need a secret window alone with the pot and access to the shed. No such gap appears in the verified timeline.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>2. The poison had to be added after 4:40 p.m., before guests lined up.</strong><br>
          Two volunteers tasted the gravy at 4:40 p.m. and noticed nothing unusual. Everyone falls ill shortly after eating, and only those who had gravy get violently sick. That means the pesticide was introduced <em>after</em> the final taste test—most likely just before guests came downstairs, while the pot sat covered on the warmer.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>3. Access to the pesticide narrows the field.</strong><br>
          The ethyl parathion came from the locked shed. Only <strong>three keys</strong> exist: Ward, Marla, and DeAndre. Julia and Caleb do not have their own keys, making it harder (though not impossible) for them to obtain the chemical unnoticed. If this were a carefully planned poisoning, the simplest path is someone who could come and go from the shed without raising questions.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>4. DeAndre had motive to avoid blame, not to risk everything.</strong><br>
          DeAndre helped cook the gravy and is devastated afterward, apologizing to everyone. Importantly, he had already been working in the kitchen when the gravy was still safe at 4:40 p.m. If he wanted to poison people, the easiest moment would have been <em>then</em>, while stirring. Instead, the contamination happens later, when he is cleaning and drifting in and out. He has access, but no clear benefit from a mass poisoning that could easily be pinned on him as the cook.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>5. The financial pressure and “missing” money point to Marla.</strong><br>
          Marla is quietly covering large shortfalls in the church budget with a personal loan. That means she has the strongest reason to fear an outside audit or a scandal that exposes her bookkeeping. A public tragedy that distracts from the finances—and pins everything on the pastor’s supposed corruption—diverts attention away from her. She also supervises the buffet line, hovering near the gravy throughout the evening.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>6. She is perfectly positioned at the critical moment.</strong><br>
          While everyone else is upstairs near the end of the sermon, Marla steps into the kitchen “to check the donation box” and carry cash to the office. That trip conveniently places her alone near both the back door (where the pesticide-laced gloves are later found) and the now-covered gravy pot. With her shed key, she can slip out, draw a small amount of ethyl parathion, return, don gloves, lift the lid, and stir it in before rejoining the service or the buffet.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>7. Julia and Caleb are red herrings.</strong><br>
          Julia’s calm behavior and the insurance mailer about her mother are meant to spook you, but the poisoning is too messy and public for a targeted insurance scam. Caleb refusing gravy also undercuts the idea that he was the true target of a plot by his father. Both add tension, but neither has as clean a combination of access, timing, and motive as Marla.
        </p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          <strong>8. The gloves and the shed key seal it.</strong><br>
          The used food-service gloves with traces of pesticide and gravy, dumped near the shed door with a “broken” camera, show the poisoner took deliberate steps to avoid skin contact and surveillance. Of the people with keys, Marla is the one who could be there without drawing attention—checking donations and “making sure the buffet stayed stocked.”</p>

        <p class="solution-step">
          In the end, the pastor makes a convenient monster for the headlines. But once you strip away assumptions and follow the access, the timing, and the money, <strong>the only suspect who fits every piece is Marla Green.</strong>
