    <h2>Case 1: The Ember Lounge Arson</h2>
    <p>On June 1st, just after closing time, The Ember Lounge went up in flames. When fire crews broke in, they found the charred remains of Marcus Kent, the bar’s manager.</p>
    <p>Arson investigators ruled it suspicious. Five people were seen at the bar that night. One of them is lying.</p>
    <p>Your mission: Solve the case by answering three questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who started the fire?</li>
      <li>What was their motive?</li>
      <li>What key evidence proves it?</li>
    </ul>

      <p><strong>Estimated Ignition Time:</strong> 1:08 a.m.</p>
      <p><strong>Victim:</strong> Marcus Kent, 37. Burned remains were found near the rear exit, keys fused in his hand.</p>

    <h2>Witness Statements</h2>
    <div class="evidence">
      <p><strong>Sasha Morgan (Bartender):</strong> “We closed out around 12:45. Marcus stayed to finish the books. He was edgy. Said something about double-checking the locks. I left at 12:50. He told me he'd handle the rest alone.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="evidence">
      <p><strong>Jared Lin (Musician):</strong> “I was hauling my guitar case out. Saw Marcus arguing with some guy in a hoodie outside the back door. Couldn’t hear what they said, but it was heated. Then I left. That's all I know.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="evidence">
      <p><strong>Bianca Dale (Regular):</strong> “I was in the restroom. When the lights flickered, I smelled smoke. I panicked and ran out without seeing anyone. I didn't even grab my purse.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="evidence">
      <p><strong>Chris Hall (Ex-Employee):</strong> “Look, I was just there for my final paycheck. Marcus refused to face me. I never even went inside. I left when he ignored me. We hated each other, but I'm not a killer.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="evidence">
      <p><strong>Maya Ruiz (Waitress):</strong> “I stayed to help sweep up. Marcus was tense. Kept checking over his shoulder. He told me he thought someone was following him. I left around 12:50. He seemed spooked.”</p>
